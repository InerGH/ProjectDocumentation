# Event Scheduler Console App


This is a simple console application where users can schedule events and view a list of their upcoming events. I’ve implemented the project in three languages: C#, JavaScript, and Python. Each version provides a way to add, list, and manage events, keeping track of important dates and deadlines in a quick and easy way.

## Project Goals
The main goal of this app is to help users keep track of their schedules without needing a full-blown calendar app. By running this lightweight console application, users can add events, see what’s coming up next, and remove events if needed. The app is built in three languages to explore different approaches and functionalities in C#, JavaScript (Node.js), and Python. It’s a fun way to see how similar tasks can be done across different programming environments.

## Features
- Add Events: Enter event details like date, time, and a description.
- View Events: Display a list of upcoming events sorted by date and time.
- Edit/Delete Events (optional feature): If there’s time, I’d like to add functionality to edit or remove events.

## Technologies Used

1. C# (.NET Console Application)
2. JavaScript (Node.js Console Application)
3. Python (Standard Console Application with core libraries)

## Setup Instructions
C# Version

1. Make sure the .NET SDK is installed.
2. Clone this repository and navigate to the C# project folder.
3. Open a terminal in this folder and run:  ``` dotnet run ```

JavaScript (Node.js) Version

1. Install Node.js.
2. Clone this repository and navigate to the JavaScript project folder.
3. Install any necessary dependencies with: ``` npm install ``` 

 4. Run the application with:  ``` node app.js ```

Python Version

1. Install Python.
2. Clone this repository and go to the Python project folder.
3. Run the application by entering:
   ``` python app.py  ```

## How to Use the App 

1. Run the application in your language of choice.
2. Follow the prompts on the screen:
   - To add an event, enter the event’s date, time, and description.
   - To view upcoming events, select the option to display your events list.
   - If available, use options to edit or delete events as needed.

Each of these versions works the same way for now, but there may be slight differences based on language features.

## Future Ideas

- Adding functionality for editing and deleting events.
- Enhancing the display for upcoming events to show them in a calendar view.
- Implementing cross-platform syncing if I expand this project into a desktop or mobile app.
